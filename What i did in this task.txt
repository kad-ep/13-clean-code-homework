1. Removed unused variables (ClassificationLevel.CONFIDENTIAL; ExperimentalTypes: LIFTING_BODY, HYPERSONIC; 
2. renamed experimentalPlane class to ExperimentalPlane.

3. Renamed 'Planes' package to 'planes'
4. Removed overrides of equals() and hashCode() for ExperimentalPlane because they don't change anything
5. changed statement for new ExperimentalPlane creation to match the constructor;

6. remove type from experimentalPlane 
7. removed comments from MyPlane
8. MyPlane - not specific enough naming
9. removed MyPlane class because it's not used
10. PassengerPlane - removed comments
11. Plane - abstract before public
12. Plane.getMS() - not specific enough naming; changed to Plane.getMaxSpeed()
13. Plane.Get_Max_Flight_Distance() - changed to Plane.getMaxFlightDistance() 
14. Plane.getMinLoadCapacity() - changed to Plane.getMaxLoadCapacity() because it returns maxLoadCapacity.
Also removed  int result = this.maxLoadCapacity; line.

15. Airport - left comments at the top because the look like copyright/license. Deleted all others.
16. renamed Airport.getPasPl() to Airport.getPassengerPlanes(). 
Also refactored for and if statements from one line to muptiple to be more readable.
17. Airport.getMilitaryPlanes() - deleted comments; deleted else statement cause it does nothing 
18. Airport.getTransportMilitaryPlanes() - added indents for 'for' and 'if'.
19. Removed unused sortByMaxFlightDistance() and sortByMaxSpeed() methods.
20. Removed unused print() method.
21. Substiteted List<? extends Plane> with List<Plane>

22. Runner: removed everything from main because it's not needed (mostly system.out statements)

23. Cleaned the 'AirportTest' class from all 'for', 'if' statements, refactored to methods instead.
24. in AirportTest.testGetTransportMilitaryPlanes() renamed flag to isTransportMilitaryPlane
25. removed system.out from AirportTest.testGetPassengerPlaneWithMaxCapacity
26. renamed test3 to testSortAirportPlanes
27. testHasAtLeastOneBomberInMilitaryPlanes() - renamed 'flag' to 'hasBombers' refactored Assert.fail to Assert.assertTrue
28. Moved 'Airport airport = new Airport(planes);' outside every method.
29. Removed ExperimentalTypes class (not used).
